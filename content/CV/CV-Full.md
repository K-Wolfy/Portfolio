## AI PROJECTS PORTFOLIO (2025)

### Neutral Reply | Full-Stack AI Application

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, React, Vercel AI SDK, Groq Llama 3.3-70b, Vercel (deployment)

Production-ready AI application for high-conflict communication management in co-parenting and legal contexts. Features deterministic three-step agentic workflow: safety checking, message analysis with emotional content filtering, and BIFF-style (Brief, Informative, Friendly, Firm) reply generation.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Designed modular system prompts as backend logic layers with explicit safety gates, categorisation rules, and output contracts
- Implemented defence-in-depth architecture: input validation → rate limiting → safety pattern scanning → LLM constraints → structured logging
- Built style-aware prompt generation system using strongly-typed configuration profiles (formality, tone, structure, length, lexical precision)
- Created exponential backoff retry logic with error classification for production resilience
- Developed client-side state machine orchestrating stateless API endpoints
- **Live deployment:** Hosted on Vercel with free Groq API integration
- **User feedback:** Positive reception from community support group testing (10+ users)
- **Repository:** Private GitHub repo with 100+ deployment iterations

**Demonstrated Skills:** Cognitive architecture design, prompt-as-code methodology, API development, production deployment, error handling, rate limiting, safety engineering

Customer-facing AI chat bot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) accessing extensive product documentation library. Built as university assignment for Graduate Certificate in Digital Media, subsequently tested by former employer's customer service manager.

**Key Achievements:**

- Integrated RAG system to query large product documentation knowledge base
- Designed conversation flows optimising for customer self-service
- Tested by professional customer service manager who confirmed it "worked better than their expensive commercial product"
- Successfully deployed via GitLab → Netlify pipeline
