## Welcome to My Portfolio

I am Scott Anketell, a full-stack AI engineer specialising in prompt engineering, persona development, and cognitive architecture design.

I build AI systems that communicate with precision and context-appropriate tone. My work focuses on linguistic persona engineering and agentic workflows. I design modular prompt architectures that function as deterministic logic layers, integrating natural language instructions with structural code.

I have 10+ years background in customer service management and technical training. This experience helps me bridge technical AI capabilities with business requirements. I translate customer needs into strategic prompt design, workflow orchestration, and deployed solutions.

**Core competencies include:**

- AI & Prompt Engineering (multi-agent workflows, chain-of-thought, few-shot learning)
- Linguistic Persona Engineering & Cognitive Architecture Design
- Agentic Workflow Development & LLM Orchestration
- Full-Stack AI Integration (Next.js, TypeScript, React, Vercel AI SDK)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems

**I specialise in applications where voice, tone, and contextual awareness matter:**

- Legal communication tools
- Customer service automation
- Domain-specific AI assistants

Each project prioritises clarity, defensibility, and operational precision.
